# Local AI Interface

This project is an early-stage development for a local AI application with a GUI interface, leveraging the power of Ollama to connect with a Large Language Model (LLM). This setup ensures that all processing is done locally, offering privacy and control over data.

## Overview

- **GUI Interface:** A user-friendly interface to interact with the AI, managed by `gui.py`.
- **Local LLM:** Integration of a local LLM via Ollama for offline AI capabilities.

## Project Structure

- **requirements.txt**: Lists all Python dependencies needed for the project.
- **gui.py**: Contains the code for the graphical user interface.
- **main.py**: The main script that orchestrates the application.
- **voice.py**: Handles voice input and output functionalities.
- **ai_handler.py**: Manages interactions with the local LLM.
- **constants.py**: Defines constants used across the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies:**

2. **Ensure Ollama is Installed:**
- Download and install Ollama from [Ollama's official site](https://ollama.ai/).

3. **Run the Application:**

## Usage

- Launch the application to see the GUI. 
- Interact with the AI through text or voice inputs as supported by `gui.py` and `voice.py`.

## Features

- **Local Processing:** All AI computations are done on your device, ensuring privacy.
- **Voice Interaction:** Convert speech to text and vice versa for a more natural user experience.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extendable by modifying or adding to the existing Python scripts.

## Known Issues

- This is not a final product; expect some features to be in development or incomplete.
- Performance might vary based on the local hardware and the complexity of the LLM used.

## Future Improvements

- Enhancements to the GUI for better usability.
- Additional AI functionalities and integration of more sophisticated LLMs.
- Error handling and logging improvements.
